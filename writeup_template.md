## Project: Perception Pick & Place

---

# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Extract features and train an SVM model on new objects.
2. Write a ROS node and subscribe to `/pr2/world/points` topic. 
3. Use filtering and RANSAC plane fitting to isolate the objects of interest from the rest of the scene.
4. Apply Euclidean clustering to create separate clusters for individual items.
5. Perform object recognition on these objects and assign them labels (markers in RViz).
6. Calculate the centroid (average in x, y and z) of the set of points belonging to that each object.
7. Create ROS messages containing the details of each object (name, pick_pose, etc.) and write these messages out to `.yaml` files, one for each of the 3 scenarios (`test1-3.world` in `/pr2_robot/worlds/`). 
8. Submit a link to your GitHub repo for the project or the Python code for your perception pipeline and your output.

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 pipeline implemented
#### 1. Complete Exercise 1 steps. Pipeline for filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented.


#### 2. Complete Exercise 2 steps: Pipeline including clustering for segmentation implemented.  


#### 2. Complete Exercise 3 Steps.  Features extracted and SVM trained.  Object recognition implemented.

### Pick and Place Setup

#### 1. For all three tabletop setups (`test*.world`), perform object recognition, then read in respective pick list (`pick_list_*.yaml`). Next construct the messages that would comprise a valid `PickPlace` request output them to `.yaml` format.

Spend some time at the end to discuss your code, what techniques you used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how you might improve it if you were going to pursue this project further.
